To examine the association of treatment and false alarms, a linear mixed model was fit. The final model included 290,699 datapoints from 37 participants. 
The standard deviation for the random intercept was small (0.005) indicating that there are minute individual differences in false alarms. 
Using Satterthwaite's approximation for degrees of freedom revealed that all treatments had a significant effect (p < .001) on false alarms. 
All treatments, except atomoxetine had a negative relationship on false alarm.

```
To examine the association of treatment and missed targets, a linear mixed model was fit. The final model included 28,238 datapoints from 37 participants. 
The standard deviation for the random intercept was relatively small (0.20) indicating that, although minor, there are individual differences in the mean missed targets. 
Using Satterthwaite's approximation for degrees of freedom revealed that MPH, ATM and CIT had a significant effect (p < .001) on missed targets. Placebo also had a significant effect (p = .029). 
All treatments, except MPH had a positive relationship on missed targets.

##Effects of treatment on hit rate

## Normality plot of residuals

```

To examine the association of treatment and hit rates, a linear mixed model was fit. The final model included 18,539 datapoints from 37 participants. 
The standard deviation for the random intercept was small (0.0876) indicating that, although minor, there are individual differences in the mean hit rates. 
Using Satterthwaite's approximation for degrees of freedom revealed that ATM and MPH had a significant effects (p < .001) on missed targets. Placebo also had a significant effect (p = .031). 
All treatments, except ATM had a negative relationship on missed targets.




#CHECKING THE EFFECTS OF ADDING BLOCK NUMBER 

```{r}
#Added effects of block number on false alarm
lm.FA1 <- lmer(FA ~ 1 + Treatment + BlockN + (1|SubID), data = CTET_Behaviour, REML = TRUE)
summary(lm.FA1)
confint(lm.FA1, method = "Wald", oldNames = FALSE)

##Normality plot of residuals 
hist(residuals(lm.FA1))
boxplot(residuals(lm.FA1))


```
To examine the association of treatment, block number and false alarms, a linear mixed model was fit. The final model included 290,699 datapoints from 37 participants. 
The standard deviation for the random intercept was the same as before adding block number (0.005).
Using Satterthwaite's approximation for degrees of freedom revealed that all treatments had a significant effects (p < .01) on false alarms. However, it should be noted that ATM's significance has now decreased from before. 
Blocks 8 to 12 are also significant (p < .05).
All treatments, except ATM had a negative relationship on false alarm. All singificant blocks also had a negative relationship except for block 11.


```{r}
##Added effects of block number on misses 
lm.Miss1 <- lmer(Miss ~ 1 + Treatment + BlockN + (1|SubID), data =  CTET_Behaviour, REML = TRUE)
summary(lm.Miss1)
confint(lm.Miss1, method = "Wald", oldNames = FALSE)

##Normality plot of residuals 
hist(residuals(lm.Miss1))
boxplot(residuals(lm.Miss1))

```
To examine the association of treatment, block number and missed targets, a linear mixed model was fit. The final model included 28,238 datapoints from 37 participants. 
The standard deviation for the random intercept is smaller than before adding block number (0.197), indicating less individual differences in missed targets.
Using Satterthwaite's approximation for degrees of freedom revealed that all treatments, except placebo had a significant effects (p < .001) on missed targets. 
All blocks are also significxant (p < .001).
All treatments, except MPH had a positive relationship on missed targets. All blocks also had a negative relationship.

```{r}
##Added effects of block number on hit rate  
lm.HR1 <- lmer(Hit_RT ~ 1 + Treatment + BlockN + (1|SubID), data = CTET_Behaviour, REML = TRUE)
summary(lm.HR1)

##Normality plot of residuals

```
To examine the association of treatment, block number and hit rates, a linear mixed model was fit. The final model included 18,539 datapoints from 37 participants. 
The standard deviation for the random intercept remains almost the same than before adding block number (0.874) (previously it was .876).
Using Satterthwaite's approximation for degrees of freedom revealed that all treatments, except citalopram had a significant effects (p < .05) on hit rates. This is the same as before adding the block number (smaller p value for placebo though).
Block 12 is also significant (p < .01).
All treatments, except ATM had a negative relationship on hit rates. Block 12 had a positive relationship.


#CHECKING THE EFFECTS OF ADDING BLOCK NUMBER AS INTERACTIONS

```{r}
#Added effects of block number as an interaction on false alarm
lm.FA2 <- lmer(FA ~ 1 + Treatment*BlockN + (1|SubID), data = CTET_Behaviour, REML = TRUE)
summary(lm.FA2)
confint(lm.FA2, method = "Wald", oldNames = FALSE)

##Normality plot of residuals 
hist(residuals(lm.FA2))
boxplot(residuals(lm.FA2))


```
To examine the association of treatment and its interaction with block number and false alarms, a linear mixed model was fit. The final model included 290,699 datapoints from 37 participants. 
The standard deviation for the random intercept was the same as before adding block number as an interaction (0.005).
Using Satterthwaite's approximation for degrees of freedom revealed that all treatments interacting with block number had a non-significant effects on false alarms. It should be noted that this differs from previous results of just adding block number into the equation. 
Blocks 11 and 12 are significant (p < .05).


```{r}
##Added effects of block number as an interaction on misses 
lm.Miss2 <- lmer(Miss ~ 1 + Treatment*BlockN + (1|SubID), data =  CTET_Behaviour, REML = TRUE)
summary(lm.Miss2)

The standard deviation for the random intercept is the same as adding block number (0.197).
Using Satterthwaite's approximation for degrees of freedom revealed that ATM and MPH had significant effects (p < .05) on missed targets. 
MPH had significant positive effects on missed targets for all blocks (1-10) (p <.05).

lm.HR2 <- lmer(Hit_RT ~ 1 + Treatment*BlockN + (1|SubID), data = CTET_Behaviour, REML = TRUE)

Using Satterthwaite's approximation for degrees of freedom revealed that ATM and MPH (p < .001) on hit rates. This is a different result to just adding block number into the equation. 
MPH in block 1 and 3 had a positive significant effect on hit rate (p < .01).
